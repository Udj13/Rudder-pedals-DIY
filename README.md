# Rudder pedals DIY

Pedals made of scraps and sticks. I made these pedals for my son, who is interested in small aviation. The key goal of the project was to incorporate a component from a real airplane. I didnâ€™t even bother cleaning them so that the smell of aviation grease would stay. A Hall sensor and magnet are used as the sensor, so there are no wear-and-tear parts. The Digispark module pretends to be a joystick and changes one of the axes. The code is in the attached file.

## Components:

Real pedals from an old An-2 aircraft

Digispark development board ATTINY85 (https://aliexpress.ru/item/2043055746.html)

Neodymium magnet (just magnetized to the piece of iron)

Hall sensor 49e
